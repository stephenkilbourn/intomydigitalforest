# My Digitial Forest

View the live site at https://intomydigitalforest.com/

This is the open source for my personal Digital Garden.  At least for now, it is built using  [11ty](https://github.com/11ty/eleventy) and I have leveraged te work done in the [eleventy garden](https://github.com/binyamin/eleventy-garden) template. I have a few ideas of how to shift that beyond these initial style changes, so it may diverege a lot, depending on where my interests and time goes.
