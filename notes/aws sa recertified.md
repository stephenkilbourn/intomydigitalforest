# AWS Solutions Architect Associate Again

As I mentioned in [[aws sa recertification]], I have been studying to get my certification again while doing the work I mentioned in [[learning python begins]] and working.  Lots of juggling and a slower pace than I had hoped, but I [succeeded](https://www.credly.com/badges/3f943771-9fa0-4dc5-ba20-1a61e4e48ea2/linked_in?t=rbprkk). There is definitely an emphasis on ensuring people know how to read questions and look for the details that differentiate possible solutions... or make some answers absurd. I've used A Cloud Guru for all of my cloud certifications. It ws helpful, but I definitely benefited from buying the Jon Boso practice exams on Udemy. Taking those and reading through why I got answers wrong helped me build better understanding.

Next Up, I plan to go through the AWS Developers Associate. We're about to add another baby to the mix, but hopefully I can get that cert done this summer.
