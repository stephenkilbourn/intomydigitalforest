# Hypermodern Python - Part 6 (CI/CD) and Final Thoughts

After doing the [[hypermodern python documentation]] step, this final step was wrapping things up. I've used github actions quite a bit, so it wasn't that foreign. I had never done things like creating a package to be installed with pip or the automated documentation builds with Release Drafter and readthedocs. It was all pretty slick, minus a few hiccups to work through due to me using newer versions of pyton and blindky typing, plus a braking change on one of readthedocs dependencies. It was nice to understand enough now that I saw the solution and pinned an old version of that dependency.

I now have [a repo](https://github.com/stephenkilbourn/modern-python) that is pretty swell.

I will say that python has a lot of tooling enabling the developer experience to be as nice as I've seen in javascript.  It does take a lot of configuration and know how, though. I can see why it isn't as common in the python world to use this full set up.  Hopefully, as I do this more, the tooling will become more intuitive like it has in js.
