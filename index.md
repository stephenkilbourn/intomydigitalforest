# Welcome to my digital forest
I've been interested in the idea of a digital garden after reading [Maggie Appleton's article](https://maggieappleton.com/garden-history) about the idea.  I study a lot of somewhat random things, and I am not the greatest at taking notes as I go. I have wanted to change that and document some learnings.  However, I don't have as specific of a topic as a blog warrants.  This little forest is a spot for seeds of all kinds to germinate. I suspect some ideas that I write about will just be small seedlings in the understory.  Some topics will continue to grow until they tower.
